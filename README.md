## Project - Neural Networks
**Description - ** In this project we have data that reveals if a person has leukaemia symptoms or not based on 27 tests, with results taking into account 6 different variables. The variable are as follows – 
	CELL – This tells the cellularity of the narrow clot section 
	SMEAR – This tells smear differential percentage of blasts 
	INFIL – This tells percentage of absolute marrow leukemia cell infiltrate 
	LI – This tells percentage labeling index of the bone marrow leukemia cells 
	BLAST – This tells absolute number of blasts in the peripheral blood (BLAST)
	TEMP – This tells highest temperature prior to start of treatment
