# DATA1202-Assignment-5
## Project - Neural Networks
**Description -** In this project we have data that reveals if a person has leukaemia symptoms or not based on 27 tests, with results taking into account 6 different variables. The variable are as follows –
CELL – This tells the cellularity of the narrow clot section \
SMEAR – This tells smear differential percentage of blasts \
INFIL – This tells percentage of absolute marrow leukemia cell infiltrate \
LI – This tells percentage labeling index of the bone marrow leukemia cells \
BLAST – This tells absolute number of blasts in the peripheral blood (BLAST)\
TEMP – This tells highest temperature prior to start of treatment. \
Now according to the above variables we are going to identify whether its Remission or No Remission for Leukemia. 
REMISS – 1 (Remission) , 0 (No Remission). \
To determine if a person have 1(Remission) or 0(No Remission), we will apply Neural Network theorem in this project. \
**Prerequisites and Installing** - Python Program Install - Steps are as follows
1) Go to the Anaconda website for downloads - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual (the
Anaconda installers will be near the bottom of the page)
2) Download the appropriate latest version of Anaconda (64-bit graphical installer for Python 3.9 version)
3) After your install is complete, verify it by opening Anaconda Navigator:
a) On a Windows PC, from the start menu, select Anaconda3(64-bit), then select Anaconda
Navigator. If Navigator opens, you have successfully installed Anaconda.
b) On a Mac, open Finder and then Applications. Launch the Anaconda-Navigator.app. If Navigator
opens, you have successfully installed Anaconda./

Python Libraries Install -/
1) Launch Command Prompt
a) Windows PC open the Anaconda Prompt (start menu under Anaconda3(64-bit))
b) Mac users launch the Terminal App (open Finder under Applications then go to Utilities folder).
2) Enter the following commands one at time and wait for each install to complete running./
pip install plotly/
pip install imbalanced-learn/
pip install mlxtend/
